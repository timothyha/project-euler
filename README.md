Solutions in Python for ProjectEuler.net

Although the project asks not to submit solutions online (to prevent cheating, I guess), I am keeping solutions here for my reference, in case I need to teach my kids or help myself on some algorithms. Keeping them all here will also help to revise them from time to time.
